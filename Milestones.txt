Key: Item - percentage complete, uncompleted tasks

Before next release!
  Complete rendering stuff
  Go through all actions and make sure they're using the correct mediator messages
    Operations
      ReplaceObjects
      Reparent
    EditFace
    EditEntityData
    Grouping
    Selection
    Visgroups
  Fix the 'combine entities' function
  Fix VMF visgroups
  Get rid of document tree/objects/faces messages
  Make sure decals, sprites, and models load and update correctly
  Get rid of the old decal/sprite stuff because it's the renderer's job now
  Investigate and fix decal_bug
  Decals are being clipped oddly and they're not selectable
  Pasting should apply materials/decal/sprite stuff instantly
  Render models! (MapObjectConverter)
  Review the PartialPostLoadProcess
  Grids
  When dragging, show a copy of the original selection in wireframe
  Show the correct rotate cursor in the selection tool
  Show the selection tool UI
  (maybe?) Fix the transformation bbox so it's not silly? (e.g. rotate a cube to 45 degrees, then start rotating it again and see the outline bbox)
  "Hide mask" in the texture window isn't working
  Cameras and cordon don't seem to be saving to RMF anymore...
  Using validation in the base box tool doesn't work too well. Need to cascade the invalidation?
  Internal resize handles are difficult to grab when zoomed out
  Box tool doesn't invalidate when the selected texture is changed
  No crosshair when free-looking in the 3d view
  Clip tool (and probably others) - escape is clearing the selection as well as cancelling the clip, which is probably not the desired outcome
  Rewrite the VM tool

Post-release?
  Animate models?
  Threaded VTF loading
