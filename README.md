*[Sledge alpha has been released! It's ready!][1]*

Sledge is an open-source alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource engine (and hopefully soon for Source too).
It is written in .NET and uses [Veldrid][2] for rendering, with DirectX 11.

Currently, Sledge supports Goldsource mapping and will be extended to support other BSP-based engines such as Source and Quake.

While progress is slow, I have every intention of continuing work on this project.
The current focus is on Goldsource support. After that, Source will be added, followed by a plugin system and more features.

The Sledge Editor is licensed under BSD-3.
